Launching Hadoop on AWS
----------------------
Create an Ubuntu server.
IMP points while creating are:
  t2.micro is not sufficient, because of 1GB ram. (Hadoop,ubuntu occupied 750MB, and the eclipse is not getting started since it is configured to have 250MB ram in the ini file.
Selected t2.small, with 2GB RAM and 12GB HD. (on 8GBs, only 3 GB was vacant).
