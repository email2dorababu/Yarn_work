You have 2 easy to use via terminal. Wondershaper and Trickle. There are more here: How to limit internet speed?

Anyway the basics are:

sudo apt-get install wondershaper

In terminal find out what is the name of the interface connected to your internet by using ifconfig. Could be eth0, eth1, eth2, etc... In my case is eth1. So, I would do this:

sudo wondershaper eth1 1024 256

This will give me a Download speed of 1024 Kbits and 256 Kbits Upload. Which are 128KB and 16KB.

If you want to reset that do this sudo wondershaper clear eth1
