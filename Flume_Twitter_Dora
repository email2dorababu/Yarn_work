Download flume and extract

Go to conf folder-
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here first i do a sample application that outputs the telnet inout to console.

in the conf folder, enter the below values.
first define sources r1, sinks k1 and channels c1
then configure/describe source type as netcat, bind as localhost and port 44444 
similarly configure sink as logger type 
also configure the channel as memory channel 


"Finally connect the source r1 and sink k1 via the channel c1."

# example.conf: A single-node Flume configuration

# Name the components on this agent
a1.sources = r1
a1.sinks = k1
a1.channels = c1

# Describe/configure the source
a1.sources.r1.type = netcat
a1.sources.r1.bind = localhost
a1.sources.r1.port = 44444

# Describe the sink
a1.sinks.k1.type = logger

# Use a channel which buffers events in memory
a1.channels.c1.type = memory
a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100

# Bind the source and sink to the channel
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1




Go to conf folder of flume and run the below command
flume-ng agent --conf conf --conf-file example.conf --name a1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO,console

Now open another terminal type
telnet 44444
Here now enter some text and hit enter, the message will be displayed on the flume agent.
