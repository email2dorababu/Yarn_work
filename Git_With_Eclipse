Opened the eclipse-jee-mars-R-win32-x86_64
Help->Install New software->
Click on Add button.
Name -> Egit
Url -> http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
[in eclipse website it is https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/]
select all -> Next
It will install some libraries 
once Completed, click yes and restart.

------------------------
But error came for this!!!!
cannot install from the https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/
so searched in stack overflow
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14452724/unable-to-install-egit-plugin-on-eclipe-helios

install older versions of GIT.
http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates-2.1
Restart it and Now all is set.
-----------------------------------------------------------|
Now Eclipse->WIndow->ShowView->Other
You will see 'GIT' section in the show view , expand it -> select Git Repositories

Now you can select 'Import' option in project explorer or file ->Import

Expand the 'Git' Folder -> Projects from Git.->Next
You will see local or URI.

The URI of git is not the one you see in the Webbrowser address bar.
It is the one that appears in the HTTPS clone URL section.
here i have selected - https://github.com/email2dorababu/HAD-EXAMPLES.git

Automatically fills the details-> click next.
User login details are not required since it is a public repository.

Click next-> it will show 'master' branch. select ->next
Setup the directories for that.
Next-> you will get the below options.

Import existing projects
use the new project wizard
Import as general project.

-> since we do not have a project file,
select the last option, import as general file.

that's it.. the project is imported.
but it will show error when you try to debug a java program 
it will show popup -> the selection cannot be launced.. this  is because the project is not a java project.
it is a general project. we need to tell eclipse to run it.

------------------------------|

on a separate tab, next to Console, you can see a tab "Git Repositories"
here you can see "remotes"->Origin-> if you right click you can see fetch push etc..
-----------------------------------------------|

Now how will set this as a java project in eclipse??
You "DELETE" the project, make sure that UNCHECK the "delete project contents on the disk" option.
also notedown the location. -> OK.

Now ---- File -> New-> Java project-> FOlder locaiton paste in the Locaiton and type a project name.
finish. 

Now you can open a java file and you can debug etc..
Note that -> it is not conected to GIT now.

TO make it connect, right click on the project name -> Team -> Share Project ->Git->next-> 
it automatically detects as git, because we have imported from git.. .git file will be there.

now you can fetch.. everything will be uptodate.
