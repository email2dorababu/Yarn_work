Opened the eclipse-jee-mars-R-win32-x86_64
Help->Install New software->
Click on Add button.
Name -> Egit
Url -> http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
[in eclipse website it is https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/]
select all -> Next
It will install some libraries 
once Completed, click yes and restart.

------------------------
But error came for this!!!!
cannot install from the https://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/
so searched in stack overflow
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14452724/unable-to-install-egit-plugin-on-eclipe-helios

install older versions of GIT.
http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates-2.1
Restart it and Now all is set.
-----------------------------------------------------------|
Now Eclipse->WIndow->ShowView->Other
You will see 'GIT' section in the show view , expand it -> select Git Repositories

Now you can select 'Import' option in project explorer or file ->Import

Expand the 'Git' Folder -> Projects from Git.->Next
You will see local or URI.

The URI of git is not the one you see in the Webbrowser address bar.
It is the one that appears in the HTTPS clone URL section.
here i have selected - https://github.com/email2dorababu/HAD-EXAMPLES.git

Automatically fills the details-> click next.
User login details are not required since it is a public repository.

Click next-> it will show 'master' branch. select ->next
Setup the directories for that.
Next-> you will get the below options.

Import existing projects
use the new project wizard
Import as general project.

-> since we do not have a project file,
select the last option, import as general file.

that's it.. the project is imported.
but it will show error when you try to debug a java program 
it will show popup -> the selection cannot be launced.. this  is because the project is not a java project.
it is a general project. we need to tell eclipse to run it.

------------------------------|

on a separate tab, next to Console, you can see a tab "Git Repositories"
here you can see "remotes"->Origin-> if you right click you can see fetch push etc..
-----------------------------------------------|

Now how will set this as a java project in eclipse??
You "DELETE" the project, make sure that UNCHECK the "delete project contents on the disk" option.
also notedown the location. -> OK.

Now ---- File -> New-> Java project-> FOlder locaiton paste in the Locaiton and type a project name.
finish. 

Now you can open a java file and you can debug etc..
Note that -> it is not conected to GIT now.

TO make it connect, right click on the project name -> Team -> Share Project ->Git->next-> 
it automatically detects as git, because we have imported from git.. .git file will be there.

now you can fetch.. everything will be uptodate.

Next watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V42r5REJx-M
and see all his videos - of DrBFraser

Project ->Rightclick -> team -> share project
Step1: First create local repository
  default path is fine  it will be /users/username/git
  Give Name with Prefix Local -> LocalSalesToolRepository
  I am fine with the path withing repository
  so finish -> Now the whole project is going to be in the repository. The exisiting project also moved to the local folder from workspace.
Step2: display Extra view 
  Window -> show views -> other -> git
    1. here expand the tree, select 'git repositories' and 'Git Staging'
    2. team -> history
  See under git repositories -> Local Repositories -> this is working set.
Step 3: Now see teh git tool bar
how to get-> Windows -> Customize perspective -> command group availability -> check git.

If you see the project, ritght click -> properties->the code is moved under the git repository.

Step 4: when you change any file
  project-.team->commit
  put message
  check all files yo want to commit
  Do not check class files - only source files all text, image etc check.
  
Step 5: now in git repository ->local repository-> Branches -> local -> master 
this master is the main repository, it is now created.

Note : to see the history -> right click on the local repository -> show in -> history  : this is very important to track

Step 6: now to Push this online?
Now we are going to create a remote:

  Create a new repository on git hub -> sales Tool
  copy HTTP url .
Step 7: Eclipse remote name - default is origin -> configuration PUSH -> Ok
change URL (paste the copied HTTP code)
put user id, password -> check the store in secure store to not to type every time.
VERY IMP --> in the same window, do not exit.. Click Advanced
ANother IMP is I have enabled the proxy -> then only worked, other wise error
Another imp while updating - it gave error -> I have selected FORCE update and worked.
Step 8: Now on remote we hae origin (red one marked) Push
Now it is available in git hub.

Step 9: Now Change the file -> Check in -> It is now available in local master branch.
Local-> master -> push changes upstream

Step 10: Now for Navigator tab  (window ->show)
Bin folder -> Team -> Ignore
This makes class files ignore while updation.

Now here local is following remote tracking
In Remotes -> You have master branch (after remote)

Step 11: commit -> comits to local -. Now Push changes it to upstream.
