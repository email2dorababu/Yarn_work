Go to Eclipse market place -> search for Maven -> Maven Integration for mars/juno/kepler -> install , restart eclipse.

Now instead of regular project create maven project.
New ->Other->Maven Project-> Next -> next page is where we need to select the ARCHEType.it is an imp step.
it is what kind of project you want to build?. maven will automatically generate all xmls, folders, classess that you need for project
you are developing. it will donwload all the resources you required.

I have selected the first one(since i don't know what to do)
Next screen , 
Group ID - it is always your package name. org.bigdatatech
Artifact ID - is project folder name, here "HelloWorld"
Version-> we skip here
Package -> usually we stay with the default package. org.bigdatatech, (instead of org.bigdatatech.HelloWorld)
