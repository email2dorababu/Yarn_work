Go to Eclipse market place -> search for Maven -> Maven Integration for mars/juno/kepler -> install , restart eclipse.

Now instead of regular project create maven project.
New ->Other->Maven Project-> Next -> next page is where we need to select the ARCHEType.it is an imp step.
it is what kind of project you want to build?. maven will automatically generate all xmls, folders, classess that you need for project
you are developing. it will donwload all the resources you required.

I have selected the first one(since i don't know what to do)
Next screen , 
Group ID - it is always your package name. org.bigdatatech
Artifact ID - is project folder name, here "HelloWorld"
Version-> we skip here
Package -> usually we stay with the default package. org.bigdatatech, (instead of org.bigdatatech.HelloWorld)
i.e package name is usually same as group id.

Select the maven-archetype-quickstart: 1.1 archetype. this was giving error
could not resolve archetype from any of the configured repositories.
Solution is -  fixed it by adding the maven archetype catalog to eclipse.

window->preferences->Maven->Archetypes->Add Remote Catalog

Now when i try to create a Maven project, it took a while to download all the artifacts,
now selected "maven-archetype-quickstart"

From Udemy website - Maven course:

Download the zip file, unzip.
System Variables - M2_HOME, without bin & slash. 
M2_HOME = E:\softwares\apache-maven-3.3.9
Path= xxxx path;%M2_HOME%\bin;
path= existing path ;semicolon double percentages, inbetween variable name back slash and then bin and semicolon.

now test this on command prompt by 

> mvn -version

In Linux servers, the variables need to be placed in .bash_profile , and source .bash_profile
